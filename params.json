A typical use case would be to force declining financial time series forecasts to converge to zero instead having negative values.\r\n\r\nThe *corset* function allows to introduce boundary constraints in series, time series as well as in *forecast* & *gts/hts* objects.\r\n\r\nIn particular, when applied on a *forecast* object it does not only apply the boundaries to the forecast but aslo to the confidence intervals.\r\n",
